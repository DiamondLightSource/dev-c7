# Run in a container

Pre-built containers with dev-c7 and its dependencies already
installed are available on [Github Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/DiamondLightSource/dev-c7).

## Starting the container

To pull the container from github container registry and run:

```
$ docker run ghcr.io/diamondlightsource/dev-c7:latest --version
```
