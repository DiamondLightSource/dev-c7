# dev_c7

A Diamond Light Source specific developer container

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/dev-c7>
:---:           | :---:
Docker          | `docker run ghcr.io/diamondlightsource/dev-c7:latest`
Documentation   | <https://diamondlightsource.github.io/dev-c7>
Releases        | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/dev-c7/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from dev_c7 import __version__

print(f"Hello dev_c7 {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m dev_c7 --version
```
